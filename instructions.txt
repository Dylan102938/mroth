1. Check if you have Python installed. Enter the following command into your terminal:

python --version

If you get an error, stating that python is not recognized, try this the alternate command:

python3 --version

If both result in error, you need to install python. If one or both of the commands worked, the command that resulted in
version 3 and you can skip Step 2.[something] is the version you want to use.



2. Install Python: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3-macosx10.9.pkg



3. Once you have Python installed, move the zip file I sent you on Fiverr to your Desktop, and unzip the file.



6. In your Finder, open the folder and replace accounts.csv with your real accounts.csv file. Ensure that that new file
is also titled exactly "accounts.csv".



4. Open your terminal again and type the following command:

cd Desktop/bitcoin_scraper



5. You are now inside the directory of this project. Install the necessary libraries using the following command (you only
need to execute this once):

pip install -r requirements.txt

In step 1, if you used python3 --version, then here you instead want to run:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt



7. Run the python program in your terminal:

python3 scraper.py



8. The results are outputted in the file output.csv. You can make a copy of this file, and do anything you want with it,
but make sure you don't alter the program-generated file, as the program relies on it to recognize where to start scraping
from next time you run the code.
